# Go-Hexagonal

Go-based implementation of the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters), featuring both a HTTP server and a TCP server/client for P2P file transfers.

-   Web server implemented with Gin
-   Database handling with GORM and PostgreSQL
-   TCP file transfer service

## Installation ðŸ”§

### Prerequisites

-   Go 1.24 (or Docker)

### Steps

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GheistLycis/Go-Hexagonal.git
cd Go-Hexagonal
go mod tidy
```

Set a `.env` according to the `env.example` in the root.

To compile:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh <CMD="web"> <OUTPUT="main"> <OS=user_os> <ARCH=user_os_arch>

# Or
make build ARGS="<CMD="web"> <OUTPUT="main"> <OS=user_os> <ARCH=user_os_arch>"
```

Where CMD is "web", "tcp" or "cli".

## Features ðŸ’»

### Web Server

#### Prerequisites

-   PostgreSQL 16.x (or Docker)

Create two types in your database, user_gender and user_status, as described in `src/user/domain/user.go`.

#### Usage

Start the HTTP server with:

```sh
./scripts/web.sh

# Or
make web

# Or, with Docker
make compose-up-web
```

Access it at `http://localhost:<WEB_PORT>`

### TCP Server

#### Usage

Start the TCP server to receive files with:

```sh
./scripts/tcp.sh

# Or
make tcp

# Or, with Docker
make compose-up-tcp
```

### CLI

#### Usage

Start the CLI to send files to the TCP server with:

```sh
./scripts/cli.sh <ADDRESS> <PORT> <FILE_PATH>

# Or
make cli <ADDRESS> <PORT> <FILE_PATH>

# Or, with Docker
make compose-up-cli <ADDRESS> <PORT> <FILE_PATH>
```

## Roadmap ðŸš€

-   âœ… **Web server**: Hexagonal POC in Go
-   âœ… **TCP server**: Server to receive P2P file transfers
-   âœ… **CLI cmd**: Implement an entry point for the file_transfer module to serve as the client to the TCP server, removing the need to use external tools to send files (such as netcat)
-   **GUI**: Build an interface to interact with both CLI and TCP commands
-   âœ… **Dockerization**: Implement Docker to avoid any initial setup
-   **Unit tests**: Implement unit test coverage
